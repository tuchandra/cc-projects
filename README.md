Extensions and projects for the adoptable site ClickCritters.

[Click Critters](https://www.clickcritters.com) is a virtual adoptable site where users can collect adoptables, socialize, and play games.
One feature on the site is the 'Click Exchange'.
You repeatedly answer questions to earn credits for your adoptables, which are later turned into levels.

This subsumes separate repos that I've made over the years: shortcuts and a queue for the Click Exchange, a helper for the Click Forest Classic, and various one-off event utilities.

## Installation (Firefox)

(Chrome will likely work with similar instructions, but I've only developed on Firefox.)

1. Download all of these files by clicking **Code**, then "Download ZIP"
2. Unzip the file
3. In Firefox, go to the top right and click on the 3-lines menu. Click **Add-ons**.
4. Check the Settings icon in the top-right of the Add-ons page, then choose **Debug Add-ons**.
5. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** ...
6. Find the folder you just downloaded, and select the `manifest.json` file to upload.
